00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,001
Here is the transformation framework. For a new function g of x equals

2
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:06,872
a times f of k times x minus d, plus c, the point

3
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:10,035
mapping is x prime equals x over k plus d, and y prime

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,254
equals a y plus c. Inside changes act horizontally on x; outside changes

5
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:18,062
act vertically on y. A negative a reflects across the x axis, and

6
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:20,406
a negative k reflects across the y axis.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,978
Now, the problem. We are given g of x equals negative f of

8
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:28,418
minus x minus one, plus three, and the point one, negative two lies

9
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:30,986
on the graph of f. We will find its image under g.

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,675
Let us move to the coordinate plane and track the image step by step.

11
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,434
We begin at the point one, negative two on f.

12
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,425
First, reflect across the y axis. The

13
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:43,217
x coordinate changes sign; y is unchanged.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,609
Next, translate one unit to the left.

15
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,727
Only the x coordinate decreases by one.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,617
Now, reflect across the x axis. The

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,637
y coordinate changes sign; x is unchanged.

18
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,495
Finally, translate upward by three units. Only

19
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:58,421
the y coordinate increases by three.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,956
Collecting all steps, the resulting point is negative two, five.
